# Pre installation steps

Change the docker Version in the following file before linking:-

> Change directory

```
cd generators/base-docker
```

open docker-utils.mjs and change the line

> const dockerVersion = stdout.split(' ')[2].replace(/,/g, '');

to

> const dockerVersion = [DockerVersion];

for example

> const dockerVersion = "20.10.17";

Above pre installation step is to solve the below mentioned problem:-

file:///${PATH_TO_JHIPSTER_DIR}/generator-jhipster/dist/generators/base-docker/docker-utils.mjs:45
            const dockerVersion = stdout.split(' ')[2].replace(/,/g, '');
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'replace')
    at file:///${PATH_TO_JHIPSTER_DIR}/generator-jhipster/dist/generators/base-docker/docker-utils.mjs:45:55

Change the docker Version in the following file before linking:-

> Change directory

```
cd generators/docker-compose
```

open generator.mjs and change the line

> const composeVersion = stdout.split(' ')[2].replace(/,/g, '');

to

> const composeVersion = [ComposeVersion];

for example

> const composeVersion = "1.29.2";
